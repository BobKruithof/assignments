##Research question
Can we predict the unemployment rate in the Netherlands with google searching? / Is there a correlation between google searching and the actual unemployment rate in the Netherlands?

##Motivation
blablabla..
Information about the unemployment raate can be valueable to the state and companies and therefore it could be interesting to see if we can use google searching as a proxy for the unemployment rate. We mean by google searching, searching words such as 'New job' ('nieuwe baan') and unemployment benefits ('werkeloosheids uitkering'/'WW'). This research is inspired by 'Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data' Ginsberg et Al. (2009). Here they show that they can try to predict the flue outbreak. In this research we will see if there is a correlation between google searching and the unemployment rate in the Netherlands.
