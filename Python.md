##Research question
Can we predict the unemployment rate in the Netherlands with google searching? / Is there a correlation between google searching and the actual unemployment rate in the Netherlands?

##Motivation
blablabla..
Information about the unemployment raate can be valuable to the state and companies and therefore it could be interesting to see if we can use google searching as a proxy for the unemployment rate. We mean by google searching, searching words such as 'New job' ('nieuwe baan') and unemployment benefits ('werkeloosheids uitkering'/'WW'). This research is inspired by 'Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data' Ginsberg et Al. (2009). Here they show that they can try to predict the flue outbreak. In this research we will see if there is a correlation between google searching and the unemployment rate in the Netherlands.

##Main assumptions


##Data
To answer the research question we used data of two different sources.
**Unemployment rate**
First of all we used data about the unemployment rate. This data is gathered from Statistics Netherlands (CBS). We looked at  
the data from 2010 to 2015 and looked at the unemploymet rate on a monthly basis.

**Google Trends**
The other source we used is Google Trends. We use index numbers for the amount of searches for specific words, that we think people will search for when they are unemployed. We have choosen **7??** words, where some of them indicate search for unemployment benefits and others indicate searches for a new job.
