* July 2015: **Volunteer work Tanzania and Zanzibar**
  * Teaching children, between 10 and 13 years old, English and Mathematics. Here I learned to speak in front of a group.

I also used different teaching methods than the real teachers, so that both the children and teachers learned a lot from us.
  * Refurbishing schools, like painting and making attributes for the playground.

  * Supporting the staff at the orphanage for children between 0 and 6 years old. I took care of the children and taught the older children English by playing games and singing songs.
